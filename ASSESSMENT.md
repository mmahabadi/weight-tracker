# Assessment (FE)

## Introduction

We've created a platform to support people in setting goals and having the right conversations. We've mainly focused on (personal) development in the work environment. But it is also very interesting to support people to live healthier lives!

That's why today we will create a web app application that supports people in reaching a target weight. The user should be able to track their weight on a daily basis so they can get continuous insight into their progress - and reach their goals easily!

It's a short assignment, so we understand it's not a finished application. You're allowed to use all the tools you use normally like Google or Stack Overflow.

## Requirements

For this application we'vre created the following requirements:

* User will use the app on a desktop (webapp)
* User can enter their weight on a daily basis
* User can add a description with each weight entry
* User can see the development of their weight
* User can set a target weight / goal
* User can see the progress towards their goal
* You don't have to create inlog / user functionality (single-user app)
* You don't have to persist the data (eg database)
* You're not required to write unit tests (but it is allowed), but we will ask you afterwards what you would like to test and how you would do this.

## Project

There is an Angular 11 project with Bootstrap 5 and Angular Testing Library setup for you - `npm start` runs the application.
The product owner (Jesse) is available for questions.

Good luck - and don't forget to have fun making this assignment ;-)
